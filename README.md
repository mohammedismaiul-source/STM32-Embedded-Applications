# STM32 Embedded Applications (STM32F4 Series)

This repository contains a small collection of **application-level projects** for the STM32F4 series
microcontroller (tested on Nucleo-F446RE).  
Each project focuses on a specific embedded concept such as CAN communication, low-power modes,
timers/PWM and RTC standby/wakeup.

All examples are written in C using STM32CubeIDE and the STM32 HAL.
